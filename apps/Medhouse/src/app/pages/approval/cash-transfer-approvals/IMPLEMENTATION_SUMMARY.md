### 4. VB6 Form Equivalents

| VB6 Form Element | Angular Component | Notes |
|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `grdData` | `ft-data-grid` | Main approvals grid with selection |
| `dteFrom/dteTo` | Date input controls | Filter date range |
| `cmbStatus` | Status dropdown | Filter by approval status |
| `btnadd_Click` | `addApproval()` | Add new transfer approval |
| `btnForward_Click` | `forwardApproval()` | Forward to Accounts dept |
| `btnReject_Click` | `rejectApproval()` | Reject with reason |
| `btnEdit_Click` | `printApproval()` | Print approval form |
| `grdData_DblClick` | `onRowDoubleClick()` | Post transfer (Accounts) |
| `cmbStatus_Click` | Manual load button | Changed to explicit user action |
| Form_Load permissions | `setUserPermissions()` | Department-based access control |

### 5. Service Layer Architecture

#### API Integration
- **HttpBase Service Integration**: Uses existing `HttpBase` service methods
- **Observable Pattern**: RxJS Observables for async operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user feedback
- **Promise to Observable**: Conversion from HttpBase promises to Angular Observables

#### Key Service Methods
- `getCashTransferApprovals()`: Load filtered approvals
- `forwardApproval()`: Forward to department
- `rejectApproval()`: Reject with reason
- `postApproval()`: Post to accounting system
- `getUserPermissions()`: Department-based permissions
- `calculateTransferBalance()`: Balance validation

### 6. State Management

#### Component State
```typescript
interface CashTransferApprovalsState {
  loading: boolean;
  selectedApproval: CashTransferApprovalView | null;
  filterCriteria: CashTransferFilterCriteria;
  userDepartment: UserDepartments;
  canApprove/canReject/canForward/canPost/canAdd: boolean;
}
```

#### Filter Criteria
- Date range (from/to dates)
- Status selection
- User department context

### 7. UI/UX Enhancements

#### Visual Design
- **Gradient Headers** with modern styling
- **Card-based Layout** for better organization  
- **Status Color Coding** for quick visual feedback
- **Balance Highlighting** (red for negative, green for positive)
- **Loading States** with spinners and overlays
- **Responsive Design** for mobile/tablet devices

#### User Experience
- **Department-specific Instructions** and guidance
- **Permission Awareness** (disabled buttons for restricted actions)
- **Confirmation Dialogs** for critical actions
- **Toast Notifications** for success/error feedback
- **Keyboard Navigation** support
- **Print-friendly Styles** for reporting

### 8. Security & Permissions

#### Role-based Access Control
| Department | Add | Forward | Reject | Post | View All |
|------------|-----|---------|--------|------|----------|
| CEO | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Operations | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| GM | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Accounts | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sales | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

#### Data Validation
- Required field validation
- Amount > 0 validation  
- Customer selection validation
- Sufficient balance checking
- Date range validation

### 9. Integration Points
